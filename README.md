AI Python based HCL Hackathon.
📌 1. Project Overview

This project predicts whether a customer will return an item (Yes/No) based on historical transaction data.
Returns have a major impact on revenue, logistics, and customer experience.
Using machine learning, we classify each purchase as Returned (1) or Not Returned (0).

🎯 2. Objective

Build a classification model that predicts if an order will be returned.

Use retail transactional data containing customer, product, revenue, refund, and order details.

Deploy a simple UI interface for real-time predictions.
